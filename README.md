MyBucket is a web application that allows users to add wishes to their bucket list and proceeds to find an opportunity for them to complete them.

Our stack:
Backend: Meteor
Frontend: Bootstrap, jQuery, Meteor 
APIs: Yelp Search, Google Reverse Geocoding

The website was mainly structured upon the tutorial in the Discover Meteor book (https://book.discovermeteor.com/)

The login system was created based on the code found in David Turnbull's "Your Second Meteor Application" book (http://meteortips.com/second-meteor-tutorial/user-accounts/ and http://meteortips.com/second-meteor-tutorial/validation/).
In addition, we incorporated the examples presented in "Building a customized accounts ui for Meteor" by Ben McMahen (http://blog.benmcmahen.com/post/41741539120/building-a-customized-accounts-ui-for-meteor)

A lot of googling went into figuring out how to implement certain features.

Future Plans:
Implement a different API for each of the categories
